# Clan Creatives
## What they Needed
Clan Creatives is a vibrant design agency located in Kenya, focusing on the blend of creativity, technology, and design. The agency sought a visually appealing and highly functional website that would act as both a portfolio and a means for client interaction. They needed a website that would not only showcase their creative work but also function as a professional platform to attract potential clients. They required a space to provide detailed descriptions of their projects, enhanced by high-quality visuals and links to live demos. Additionally, the site needed to embody their brand’s modern and innovative identity while ensuring it was user-friendly and accessible to both technical and non-technical visitors.

## What had to be solved
The main challenge was to build a website that not only looked amazing but also remained quick and responsive. While high-quality visuals are important, they can often lead to slower performance, so optimizing images and load times was essential. Incorporating features like dynamic portfolio layouts and live demo links required us to thoughtfully design both the frontend user experience and the backend functionality. Our aim was to make it easy for their team to update the site without relying on ongoing developer assistance.

## How It Came Together
The completed website strikes the perfect balance between aesthetics and usability. Every project features its own dedicated page, complete with in-depth descriptions, stunning screenshots, and links to live demos. We utilized a responsive grid system that adjusts effortlessly to various screen sizes, guaranteeing a seamless experience for users on any device. The backend runs on WordPress, offering a user-friendly interface for straightforward updates. The outcome? A polished, professional platform that highlights Clan Creatives’ work while maintaining speed, intuitiveness, and visual appeal.

The Junction Mall stands out as a premier shopping destination in Kenya. The aim was to develop a website that captures the essence of their vibrant brand while providing a user-friendly experience for visitors. The site was designed to include an up-to-date directory of stores, restaurants, and services, and to serve as a promotional platform for events and discounts. Furthermore, the mall sought to incorporate an interactive calendar feature to keep users informed about activities, a section highlighting sustainability initiatives, and an easy way to subscribe to newsletters for exclusive offers and updates. The website was intended to ensure seamless navigation, enabling both new and returning visitors to quickly and efficiently access the information they need.

## What Had to Be Solved
One of the biggest challenges was designing a website that could cater to the diverse range of information the mall wanted to present. It needed to have a robust system to handle a constantly updating directory of stores, as well as event listings that could change frequently. The user experience had to be straightforward, ensuring that visitors could easily navigate the site, even when accessing it from mobile devices. Additionally, the sustainability section had to highlight the mall's eco-friendly initiatives without overwhelming the rest of the site’s content. Another important factor was the integration of a subscription system for updates, ensuring that customers could easily sign up for newsletters without a complicated process.
